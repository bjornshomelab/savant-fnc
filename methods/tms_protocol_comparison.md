## C2.1 Key Studies

### C2.1.1 Snyder et al. (2003–2009)

**Citation:** Snyder, A. W. (2009). Explaining and inducing savant skills: Privileged access to lower level, less-processed information. *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*, 364(1522), 1277-1284.

**Target region:** Left anterior temporal cortex

**Participants:** Neurotypical adults with no exceptional abilities

**Stimulation protocol:**
- Low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS)
- Applied to left anterior temporal lobe
- Duration: 15 minutes typical

**Tasks tested:**
- Rapid dot estimation (numerosity judgment)
- Drawing tasks (accuracy and detail)
- Proofreading (detecting errors)
- Pattern detection and completion

**Key findings:**
- 10 out of 12 participants (83%) showed temporary improvements resembling aspects of savant performance
- Enhanced detail orientation and pattern detection
- Reduced top-down conceptual interference
- Effects were reversible when stimulation stopped
- No long-term changes observed

**FNC interpretation:**

The left anterior temporal cortex is associated with conceptual and semantic integration—key components of consensus-reality processing. Transient disruption reduces top-down constraints, enabling more direct access to pattern structure.

This supports the FNC claim that savant-like abilities reflect **access** to patterns available to the system but normally filtered out by consensus-reality tuning, rather than creation of new computational capacity.

**Specific FNC predictions confirmed:**
1. **Latent access** – Abilities exist in neurotypical individuals but are normally suppressed
2. **Reversibility** – Temporary Node retuning produces temporary access changes
3. **Domain specificity** – Enhancement occurs in pattern domains (not social/narrative)

### C2.1.2 Chi & Snyder (2011) – Numerical Estimation

**Citation:** Chi, R. P., & Snyder, A. W. (2011). Facilitate insight by non-invasive brain stimulation. *PLoS ONE*, 6(2), e16655.

**Key finding:** TMS to left anterior temporal lobe improved numerical estimation and insight problem-solving

**FNC relevance:** Further supports the pattern-access interpretation—numerical cognition involves accessing mathematical Field structures

### C2.1.3 Young et al. (2013) – Creativity and Insight

**Citation:** Young, R. L., Ridding, M. C., & Morrell, T. L. (2013). Switching skills on by turning off part of the brain. *Neurocase*, 10(3), 215-222.

**Key finding:** TMS-induced temporary drawing improvements in non-artists

**FNC relevance:** Artistic ability (accurate visual reproduction) involves access to spatial Field structures normally filtered by conceptual processing

## C2.2 Methodological Considerations

### C2.2.1 Replication Status

**Strengths:**
- Multiple independent replications of core findings
- Consistent target region (left anterior temporal)
- Reproducible effect sizes

**Limitations:**
- Small sample sizes in early studies
- Limited diversity in tasks tested
- Short-term effects only documented

**Ongoing research:**
- Larger-scale replication studies
- Longer-duration effects investigation
- Individual difference predictors

### C2.2.2 Mechanism Interpretation

**Traditional neuroscience interpretation:**
- "Disinhibition" of right hemisphere
- Release from left hemisphere "tyranny"
- Enhanced access to raw sensory data

**FNC interpretation:**
- Reduced consensus-reality filtering (Node adjustment)
- Enhanced coupling to Field structures
- Shift from conceptual to pattern-based processing

**Key difference:** FNC predicts access to pre-existing structures, not enhancement of local processing capacity.

## C2.3 FNC-Driven TMS Experiments (Proposed)

### C2.3.1 Systematic Domain Mapping

**Goal:** Map stimulation sites to specific Field domains

**Protocol:**
- Test multiple cortical regions
- Assess domain-specific enhancement (math, music, spatial, temporal)
- Predict which sites enhance which abilities based on FNC model

**FNC predictions:**

| Target Region | Predicted Enhancement | Field Domain |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Left anterior temporal | Geometric/artistic | Spatial structures |
| Left dorsolateral PFC | Mathematical | Relational structures |
| Left posterior temporal | Musical/harmonic | Auditory-temporal patterns |
| Left frontal | Calendar calculation | Temporal patterns |

### C2.3.2 Trade-off Studies

**Goal:** Test whether enhancement in pattern domains correlates with reduction in consensus-reality processing

**Protocol:**
- Apply TMS to enhance pattern access
- Simultaneously measure social cognition, narrative processing, contextual reasoning
- Test FNC prediction of inverse relationship

**Expected result:** Enhancement in savant-like abilities correlates with temporary reduction in social-contextual processing

### C2.3.3 Individual Difference Predictors

**Goal:** Identify who responds to TMS-induced tuning

**Measures:**
- Baseline autism spectrum traits (AQ, RAADS-R)
- Baseline pattern vs. social orientation
- Baseline brain connectivity patterns

**FNC prediction:** Individuals already partially tuned toward pattern processing (higher autism traits) show larger TMS effects

## C2.4 Safety and Ethics

### C2.4.1 TMS Safety Guidelines

All proposed experiments must follow established TMS safety protocols:
- Screening for contraindications (seizure history, metal implants)
- Monitoring for adverse effects
- Maximum stimulation parameters within safety limits
- Trained operators only

### C2.4.2 Ethical Considerations

**Informed consent must include:**
- Temporary nature of effects
- Potential risks and discomfort
- Right to withdraw at any time
- No guaranteed benefits to participants

**Special considerations:**
- Enhancement vs. treatment distinction
- Implications of temporary cognitive enhancement
- Equitable access to interventions if proven effective

## C2.5 Comparison with Other Neuromodulation Techniques

### tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation)

**Advantages:**
- Easier to administer
- Portable devices available
- Potentially longer-lasting effects

**FNC relevance:** Could provide complementary evidence for tuning effects

### Pharmacological Interventions

**Relevant studies:**
- Effects of psychedelics on pattern perception
- NMDA antagonists and insight problem-solving

**FNC relevance:** Chemical modulation may also affect Node tuning parameters

## C2.6 Open Questions

1. **Duration:** Can repeated TMS sessions produce longer-lasting tuning changes?
2. **Transfer:** Do enhancements in one task transfer to related domains?
3. **Individual differences:** Why do some participants show stronger effects?
4. **Mechanism specificity:** Is the effect purely inhibitory or also facilitatory?
