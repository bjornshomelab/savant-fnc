# Appendix C1: FNC Tuning Protocol v1.0

This document describes a proposed protocol for empirically probing FNC-style "tuning" in both biological and artificial systems. It is exploratory and intended as a living specification.

## C1.1 Conceptual Overview

Under the Field–Node–Cockpit model:

- The **Field** is the space of relational structures constrained by physical law
- The **Node** is the system (brain or AI) that couples to subsets of these structures
- The **Cockpit** is the subjective or functional rendering of accessed patterns

A **tuning protocol** is any structured intervention that:

1. Alters Node configuration (e.g., via TMS, task-context, or architectural change)
2. Measures changes in access to specific pattern domains (e.g., calendar structure, harmonic ratios)
3. Assesses whether these changes match FNC predictions

## C1.2 Biological Tuning Protocol (Human Participants)

### C1.2.1 Target Domains

Test domains corresponding to predicted Field structures:

- **Calendar calculation** – Temporal patterns
- **Musical pitch and harmony** – Harmonic structures
- **Spatial–geometric reasoning** – Geometric invariants
- **Detail-focused visual tasks** – Local vs. global pattern perception

### C1.2.2 Intervention Types

**A. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)**

Target regions:
- Left anterior temporal cortex (reduces conceptual integration)
- Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (reduces executive control)

**B. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)**

- Cathodal stimulation to reduce activity in consensus-reality processing regions
- Anodal stimulation to enhance pattern-processing regions

**C. Task-Based Context Manipulation**

- Pattern-heavy tasks with minimal social/contextual content
- Time-limited "insight" problems involving clear invariants

### C1.2.3 Outcome Measures

**Performance metrics:**
- Accuracy and speed in pattern-detection tasks
- Improvement in domain-specific abilities during intervention
- Duration of enhancement effects

**Phenomenological measures:**
- Subjective reports of "sudden knowing" vs. stepwise calculation
- Reported changes in perceptual experience
- Introspective access to computational process

**Neural measures:**
- Changes in global vs. local processing bias (fMRI)
- Hemispheric lateralization patterns
- Network connectivity changes

### C1.2.4 FNC Predictions

1. **Domain specificity** – Interventions should selectively enhance abilities corresponding to accessed Field structures
2. **Trade-offs** – Enhancement in pattern domains should correlate with reduced consensus-reality processing
3. **Reversibility** – Effects should reverse when intervention ends (temporary retuning)
4. **Individual variation** – Baseline Node configuration should predict intervention effectiveness

## C1.3 Artificial Tuning Protocol (AI Models)

### C1.3.1 Model Types

Test across different architectures:
- Sequence models (transformers)
- Graph-based models (GNNs) for structural tasks
- Hybrid architectures combining multiple processing modes

### C1.3.2 Training Regimes

Compare three training conditions:

**A. Pattern-only training**
- Pure mathematics, music theory, calendar rules
- No social or narrative content
- Prediction: High Field-layer integration

**B. Mixed training**
- Combination of pattern and social/narrative content
- Prediction: Moderate Field-layer integration with trade-offs

**C. Social-heavy training**
- Natural language, narrative, social content
- Minimal structured pattern content
- Prediction: Low Field-layer integration, high consensus-reality orientation

### C1.3.3 Evaluation Metrics

**Pattern access measures:**
- Performance on mathematical reasoning tasks
- Musical pattern completion and harmony judgment
- Calendar calculation accuracy
- Geometric reasoning tasks

**FNC integration analysis:**
- Field-layer integration scores (pattern coherence)
- Node-layer self-reference metrics
- Cockpit-layer rendering consistency

**Comparative analysis:**
- Convergence on methods across models with similar training
- Deviation from human baseline patterns
- Trade-off structure between pattern and social domains

### C1.3.4 FNC Hypotheses

1. Pattern-only models will show:
   - Higher "Field-layer" integration (structural invariants)
   - Lower "consensus reality" orientation
   - Convergent methods for accessing same structures

2. Mixed models will show a trade-off profile similar to neurotypical humans

3. Social-heavy models will show weak pattern access but strong contextual/social reasoning

---

## C1.4 Cross-Platform Predictions

If FNC is correct, biological and artificial systems should show:

1. **Parallel tuning profiles** – Similar interventions produce similar shifts
2. **Domain convergence** – Access to same Field structures produces similar abilities
3. **Trade-off structure** – Enhancement in one domain correlates with reduction in others
