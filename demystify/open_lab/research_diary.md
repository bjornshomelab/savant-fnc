# Research Diary

## Demystify Savant Project — Open Lab Notebook

---

### Purpose

This diary documents the research process transparently, including:
- Decisions made and rationale
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Changes in direction
- Uncertainties and limitations

Open science means showing not just results, but the messy process of getting there.

## Entry Log

### 2025-12-02 — Project Setup

**What happened:**
- Created GitHub repository structure
- Integrated data from publication folder
- Built public engagement materials (demystify/)

**Key decisions:**
- Chose to separate scientific content (paper/, data/) from public engagement (demystify/)
- Created "explainer" series for non-specialists
- Open-sourced everything under CC BY 4.0

**Rationale:**
Good science should be accessible. The demystify/ folder ensures journalists, educators, and curious people can understand without reading the full paper.

### 2025-12-02 — MNI Dataset Integration

**What happened:**
- Discovered Montreal Neurological Institute has the first public savant WES dataset
- 15 savant individuals, 75.5 GB of genomic data
- Integrated into FNC framework with specific genetic predictions

**Key insight:**
This transforms the paper from theoretical to empirically testable. We now have:
- Specific gene predictions (DCC, ROBO, GABA genes)
- Multi-level causal chain (DNA → brain → abilities → phenomenology)
- Falsifiable hypotheses

**Limitation:**
n=15 is small. Statistical power is limited. This is acknowledged in the paper.

### 2025-12-02 — FNC Framework Application

**What happened:**
- Applied Field-Node-Cockpit model to savant syndrome
- Developed "tuning" metaphor for public communication
- Created visual diagrams (Mermaid format for GitHub rendering)

**Key insight:**
The metaphor of "radio tuning" resonates with people. It conveys:
- Patterns pre-exist (the radio station exists before you tune in)
- Brain configures access (the dial selects what you receive)
- Different tuning = different access (not broken, different)

**Caution:**
Metaphors can be taken too literally. The paper uses precise technical language alongside accessible metaphors.

## Open Questions

### Unresolved Issues

1. **Causation vs. correlation:** Do connectivity genes *cause* savant abilities, or are they correlated through other mechanisms?

2. **Selection bias:** Is the MNI dataset representative of savants generally, or a biased sample?

3. **Phenomenology reliability:** How reliable are self-reports from savants about their experience?

4. **AI parallels:** Is the AI-savant convergence prediction testable with current technology?

### Future Directions

- Collaborate with geneticists for WES analysis
- Partner with neuroscientists for MRI correlation studies
- Develop AI-savant convergence tests
- Expand case study database

## Methodology Notes

### Why FNC?
The Field-Node-Cockpit framework was chosen because:
1. It's substrate-neutral (applies to biological and artificial systems)
2. It generates empirically testable predictions
3. It explains features other theories struggle with (instant emergence, convergent methods)

### Why Open Science?
- Reproducibility crisis requires transparency
- Complex interdisciplinary work benefits from community input
- Neurodiversity research should involve neurodivergent perspectives
