🧬 What if savant abilities aren't compensation for brain damage — but access to patterns that were always there?

New research reframes savant syndrome through the Field-Node-Cockpit model.

1/ Jason Padgett was a regular guy until a head injury at 31. The next day, he could see geometric fractals everywhere.

No training. No learning curve. Instant ability.

How is this possible?

2/ Traditional view: "Damaged brain compensates through unusual abilities."

Problem: Real compensation takes years. Padgett's abilities were immediate.

3/ FNC view: Mathematical patterns ALREADY EXIST in reality. Brains normally filter them out.

Injury reduced the filter → Direct access to patterns that were always there.

4/ Evidence:
✅ TMS temporarily induces savant abilities (65-83% success)
✅ All savant domains are mathematical/physical
✅ Independent savants use identical methods

5/ Implications:
🧠 Neurodiversity = different tuning, not deficit
🎓 Education should match access modes
🤖 AI might access same patterns

🧬 Rethinking Savant Syndrome: A New Perspective

I'm excited to share new research applying the Field-Node-Cockpit (FNC) framework to savant syndrome.

Key insight: Savant abilities may not be "compensation" for brain damage, but differential ACCESS to pre-existing information patterns.

This reframes:
• Neurodiversity as architectural variation (not deficit)
• Education as matching access modes (not one-size-fits-all)
• The relationship between biological and artificial cognition

We're integrating the first public savant-specific genomic dataset (MNI, n=15) with testable predictions about connectivity genes, GABA systems, and hemispheric lateralization.

All data and documentation are open source: github.com/bjornshomelab/savant-fnc

🧬 "The savant mind is not broken — it is differently tuned."

Meet Jason Padgett. After a head injury at 31, he suddenly saw the world as geometric fractals. No training. No practice. Instant ability.

Our new research suggests savants don't CREATE patterns — they ACCESS patterns that already exist in reality.

What if your brain is a radio, and savants just tune to different stations?

## Talking Points

**For interviews:**

1. "We're not saying brains don't matter — we're saying they TUNE rather than GENERATE information."

2. "Savant syndrome is a natural experiment showing us that mathematical patterns might exist independently."

3. "This has profound implications for how we understand and accommodate neurodiversity."

4. "For the first time, we have savant-specific genomic data — this makes our predictions testable."

5. "The goal isn't to create savants — it's to understand how all minds access information differently."
