Summary Statistics:
- Estimated 10-28% of individuals with ASD show savant-level skills in at least one domain
- Estimated 50-75% of all savants (congenital) have ASD diagnosis
- Approximately 1 in 10 people with ASD has a savant ability
- Male predominance in both ASD and savant syndrome (ratio ~4:1)

FNC Interpretation:
- ASD represents differential Node tuning favoring Field access over consensus-reality processing
- Trade-off structure: reduced social cognition ↔ enhanced pattern perception
- Not all ASD individuals show savant abilities (depends on specific tuning configuration)
- Savant abilities without ASD are possible (different pathways to Field access)
