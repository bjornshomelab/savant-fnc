Summary:
- Across studies: approximately 65-83% of neurotypical participants show temporary savant-like enhancement
- Most consistent target: left anterior temporal cortex
- Most consistent enhancement: pattern detection, detail orientation, reduced top-down processing
- Effect sizes: medium to large (Cohen's d 0.6-0.8)
- Effects are temporary and reversible (return to baseline after stimulation)

FNC Interpretation:
- TMS temporarily disrupts consensus-reality filtering (Node adjustment)
- Enhanced coupling to Field structures during disruption period
- Supports claim that savant abilities reflect ACCESS to patterns, not creation of new capacity
- Predicts: stimulation site → specific domain enhancement (geometric, numerical, artistic)

Methodological Notes:
- Low-frequency rTMS (typically 1 Hz)
- Stimulation duration: 10-15 minutes typical
- Effects last: minutes to hours post-stimulation
- Safety profile: well-established; minimal adverse effects in healthy participants
