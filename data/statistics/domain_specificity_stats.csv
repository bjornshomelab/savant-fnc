language,3,7.5,"polyglot savants; rare but documented","Treffert 2009"

Notes:
- Percentages exceed 100% because many savants show abilities in multiple domains
- Based on documented cases in savant syndrome literature (n≈40 well-documented acquired savants worldwide as of 2024)
- Domain classifications follow Treffert's taxonomy
- FNC prediction: Domains correspond to stable Field structures (mathematical, harmonic, temporal, spatial patterns)
