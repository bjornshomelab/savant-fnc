# Appendix A: Extended Case Studies – Savant Syndrome

This appendix provides structured narrative descriptions of the savant cases referenced in the main paper and in the open dataset (`cases.json`, `acquired_savant_profiles.csv`, `congenital_savant_profiles.csv`). The goal is to offer transparent, citable material that can be reused for further analysis.

All personally identifying information follows existing case-report conventions. Where appropriate, cases are identified by initials or established pseudonyms.

## A.1 Acquired Savant Cases

### A.1.1 CS_A001 – Jason Padgett (Mathematical–Geometric Acquired Savant)

**Case type:** Acquired  
**Primary domains:** Mathematics, spatial reasoning, geometric drawing  
**Onset:** Age 31, following a traumatic brain injury (assault with concussion, 2002)

**Core abilities:**
- Spontaneous perception of geometric structure in ordinary scenes
- Detailed drawing of fractal-like patterns and "sacred geometry"
- Emergence of strong interest in mathematics and physics

**Phenomenology (self-report, summarized):**

Padgett describes a transition from "ordinary" perception to seeing the world as grids, polygons, and fractals. Edges, motion, and even water flow appear quantized into discrete geometric units. He reports that the patterns feel self-evident rather than computed.

**Clinical and cognitive profile:**
- No documented exceptional mathematical ability prior to injury
- Post-injury: obsessive focus on geometric structure
- Comorbid PTSD symptoms and sensory hypersensitivity

**FNC interpretation:**

Under the FNC model, this case represents a tuning shift of the Node (brain) towards geometric Field structures—stable relational invariants of spatial transformation and wave behavior. The lack of a learning curve, the sudden onset, and the highly structured nature of the new abilities support the interpretation of *access* to pre-existing patterns rather than de novo computation.

### A.1.2 CS_A002 – Derek Amato (Musical Acquired Savant)

**Case type:** Acquired  
**Primary domain:** Music  
**Onset:** Age 39, following diving accident with concussion (2006)

**Core abilities:**
- Immediate ability to play complex piano compositions without prior training
- Compositional abilities emerged simultaneously
- Visual-spatial perception of music ("seeing" notes and patterns)

**Phenomenology (self-report, summarized):**

Amato reports that after the injury, he could "see" music as patterns and shapes. Piano keys appeared to "light up" indicating which notes to play. The experience is described as accessing information that was always present but previously inaccessible.

**Clinical and cognitive profile:**
- No musical training or exceptional ability prior to injury
- Post-injury: compulsive engagement with musical composition
- Chronic headaches and sensory hypersensitivity

**FNC interpretation:**

This case exemplifies Node retuning to harmonic Field structures. The immediate emergence of both performance and compositional abilities, without gradual skill acquisition, suggests direct access to pre-existing mathematical-harmonic patterns rather than neural plasticity creating new computational capacity.

### A.1.3 CS_A003 – Orlando Serrell (Calendar–Memory Acquired Savant)

**Case type:** Acquired  
**Primary domains:** Calendar calculation, autobiographical memory  
**Onset:** Age 10, struck by baseball (1979)

**Core abilities:**
- Can provide day-of-week for any date after injury
- Perfect recall of weather conditions for any date since injury
- No apparent computational process reported

**Phenomenology (self-report, summarized):**

Serrell reports "just knowing" the day of the week for any date. The information appears immediately without conscious calculation steps. Weather memories are described as visual—seeing the conditions as if looking at a photograph.

**Clinical and cognitive profile:**
- Typical cognitive development prior to injury
- No other exceptional abilities reported
- No significant cognitive impairments

**FNC interpretation:**

Calendar calculation represents access to temporal Field structures—mathematical regularities in timekeeping systems. The absence of introspective access to "method" supports the FNC prediction that savants access information rather than compute it. The weather memory component suggests enhanced autobiographical Field access post-injury.

## A.2 Congenital Savant Cases

### A.2.1 CS_C001 – Kim Peek (Memory–Calendar Savant)

**Case type:** Congenital  
**Primary domains:** Calendar calculation, rote memory, factual recall  
**Neuroanatomy:** Agenesis/dysgenesis of the corpus callosum; cerebellar abnormalities

**Core abilities:**
- Extraordinary memory across multiple domains (history, geography, music, literature)
- Calendar calculation across centuries
- Could read two pages simultaneously (one with each eye)

**Phenomenology (observer reports):**

Peek demonstrated instant recall of factual information and could perform calendar calculations without visible computation time. His memory appeared to have no decay—information learned decades earlier remained immediately accessible.

**Clinical and cognitive profile:**
- Significant developmental disabilities in abstract reasoning and social cognition
- Motor coordination difficulties
- Not classically autistic but showed overlapping traits

**FNC interpretation:**

Within FNC, this profile is consistent with a Node architecture that is weakly tuned to social–abstract consensus structures but strongly tuned to temporal and factual Field structures. The corpus callosum abnormalities may reduce cross-hemispheric integration that normally filters or abstracts raw pattern access. The ability to provide day-of-week for arbitrary dates with no introspective awareness of algorithmic steps supports the "direct access to structured patterns" interpretation.

### A.2.2 CS_C002 – Leslie Lemke (Musical Savant)

**Case type:** Congenital  
**Primary domain:** Music  
**Onset:** Abilities emerged around age 14

**Core abilities:**
- Could reproduce complex piano pieces after a single hearing
- Perfect pitch
- Compositional abilities
- No formal musical training

**Neurological context:**
- Perinatal complications resulting in global developmental disabilities
- Visual impairment (blind)
- Severe motor difficulties in non-musical domains

**Phenomenology (observer reports):**

Most famously, Lemke heard Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 on television and immediately reproduced it with complete accuracy. His adoptive mother reported that he appeared to "hear the structure" of music in a way that bypassed normal learning.

**FNC interpretation:**

Direct access to harmonic Field structures with minimal learning. The contrast between severe impairments in most cognitive domains and extraordinary musical ability supports the FNC model's prediction of domain-specific Field access rather than general computational enhancement.
