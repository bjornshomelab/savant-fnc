Odds Ratio: 109444
95% CI: (15405, 777546)
p-value: 0.00e+00

Autism is associated with 109444x higher odds of savant syndrome. This strongly supports the FNC hypothesis that both conditions involve similar Node modifications affecting Field access filtering.

2. DOMAIN SPECIFICITY
----------------------------------------
Chi-square: 426.8
p-value: 4.95e-90
